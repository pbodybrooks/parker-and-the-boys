                <p> No problem, Parker and the Boys have got you covered. Simply enter the weather criteria and
                    distance
                    you're willing to drive to get the weather for
                    cities within the united states. From there, pick a city from the generated list and enjoy
                    your
                    weekend!

                <h3> How does it work? </h3>
                <p>This project was built using ~400 lines of JavaScript to tackle the functionality, and the
                    Pico
                    framework to aid in structure and styling. Before use, the webpage will
                    automatically run a parent function to prepare the application. First, the user's current
                    location
                    is gathered. Next, the function will get weather information for a predefined
                    bank of cities that are saved to local storage to prevent having to fill the weather bank
                    each
                    time
                    the user visits the page. The webpage uses two APIs; one to return the user's
                    current position, and another to return each cities' position and corresponding weather.
                    From these two sets of coordinates, the Haversine method, used to calculate the distance
                    between
                    two
                    points on a sphere, is used to approximate the distance between the
                    user and the returned cities that match their desired weather and range criteria.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div id="whoDid">
                <h3> Who did what?</h3>
                <p>Parker built the entirety of the functionality of the web application and created all of the
                    interactive HTML elements on the webpage, namely the navigation bar,
                    criteria selection dropdowns, and submit buttons.
                </p>
                <p>Anthony helped build the loading bar.</p>
                <p>Jahsper helped build the loading bar and adjusted the styling such that the dropdowns become
                    inaccessible until loading is complete. He helped structure the HTML and
                    set up the dropdown selections. He also served as the team's resident GitHub "Mom" and
                    always
                    made
                    sure we had our main branch up to date, as well as addressed any merge
                    issues encountered during group coding sessions. Jahsper also handled the majority of the
                    styling -
                    selecting the color scheme for the webpage and loading bar, as well as
                    styling the returned cities cards to be displayed to the user.

            <div id="aboutTheTeam">
                <h2>Parker and the Boys</h2>
                <p>Parker is Parker Brook, and the boys are Jahsper Harrell and Anthony LaNier. There were three boys to
                    start, but after losing a fellow coder,
                    we were left with just two, but this didn't stop us from acheiving our objective: together, the
                    three of us bootcamp students created
                    an application to help those who just want to get away, but don't know where to go.
                </p>
                <p>As a team, we have a diverse background with a broad set of skills that allowed us to divide and
                    conquer the project.
